# leaflet-challenge
Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is critical in delivering essential scientific data on natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the consequences of climate and land-use change. Notably, the USGS team is constantly at the forefront of providing new methodologies and tools that cater to timely, relevant, and valuable insights into our Earth and its numerous processes.

Recognizing the vast number of data they collect internationally, the USGS has found a gap in how they meaningfully display this data. This challenge was created with this incentive in mind. The primary goal of this project is to create a robust visualization of USGS seismic data. The USGS hopes that by using this graphic, it can raise public and government knowledge. In doing so, they hope to not only shed light on the crucial difficulties that our world is dealing with, but also to perhaps acquire further money to further their efforts.

Getting Started
Begin by making a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge. Ensure that this challenge stands alone and does not add to any current repository.
Clone the repository onto your PC once it has been created.
Create a directory for the Leaflet challenge in your local git repository. It's best to name the folders after the tasks, such as Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2.
Because the challenge includes both HTML and JavaScript, remember to include all necessary files, as these are the foundation of the analysis.
Once you've completed these steps, push the modifications to GitHub.
Files Needed
The following files are recommended for download to help with the challenge's start: Files for the Module 15 Challenge.

Instructions
This challenge is divided into two parts:
Earthquake Visualization Design
The initial aim in taking on this task is to vividly show a dataset centered on earthquakes. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Data Collection: The USGS provides a wide range of seismic data that is updated every 5 minutes. Begin by exploring the USGS GeoJSON Feed and selecting a dataset that corresponds to your visualization goals. A good example is the dataset "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days." The JSON format data accessible via this URL will form the basis for the upcoming display.

Import and Visualization: Use Leaflet to create a map that strategically plots each earthquake based on its longitude and latitude. The data markers must encapsulate the magnitude of the earthquake through their size and convey the depth of the earthquake through color gradients. A deeper earthquake should have a darker tint. Allow for popups that, when activated, reveal extra details about the earthquake in question.

Create a consistent legend to accompany your map, which will improve the user's understanding of the map data.

The final visualization is expected to correspond to the map provided.
